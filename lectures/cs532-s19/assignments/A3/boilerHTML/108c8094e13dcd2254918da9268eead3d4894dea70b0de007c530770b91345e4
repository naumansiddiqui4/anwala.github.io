Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi accused President Trump of “doing an end-run” around Congress Thursday; vowing to “review our options” when the Commander-in-Chief declares a “national emergency” at the US-Mexico border.
“That’s an option. We’ll review our options. It’s important to note that when the president declares this emergency -first of all- it’s not an emergency. It’s a humanitarian challenge to us,” said Pelosi.
“In any event, the President’s doing an end-run around Congress about the power of the purse. You’ve heard me say this over and over again. Article One, the legislative branch has the power of the purse,” she added.
