Tomorrow
Wednesday, February 27, 2019 - You breeze through any outstanding chores without breaking a sweat today. You hardly feel like you are exerting effort when everything runs so smoothly. In fact, there may be so little on your plate that you end up finishing early. All this extra time frees you to engage in more visionary thinking throughout the day. You are emboldened to swing for the fences and craft a few goals that widen your scope of possibility. Whistle while you work and enjoy being in the zone.
