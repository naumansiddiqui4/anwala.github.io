Finally I did it!
Capra is dead! I can’t believe how much I hate and love this game at the same time. Already truly one of the greatest I’ve ever played.

TBH that single fight was hard only because the setup. Capra right at the door with the dogs, and all the trees and shit blocking half the screen... Nightmare. The fight itself wasn’t that bad.

yeah, and they put you in a 5 ft by 10 ft alcove of the game. just found him last night and beat him after 3 tries. switching to a faster sword helped take out the dogs, then i switched back over to the claymore and beat his ass
