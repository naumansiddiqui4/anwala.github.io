BlackBerry KEY2 ad shows how couples communicate in the smartphone era

With today being Valentine's Day, BlackBerry Mobile released the perfect ad for the BlackBerry KEY2 . Set in a restaurant, we see a couple across from each other at a table. The man picks up his KEY2 and snaps a picture of his girlfriend. After she receives the photo, she returns with a GIF of singer Shakira from The Voice that says "How you doin'?" He responds with a GIF showing a scene from the movie Poetic Justice where Tupac tells Janet Jackson, "I think you kind of fly." The couple hold hands on the table setting up the tag line, "Better Together."
The ad, which doesn't feature any dialogue and contains background music only, is showing how people communicate these days. Here is a couple, obviously in love, sitting right across from each other and instead of talking, they both use their BlackBerry KEY2 to let the other person know how they feel. And the messages they sent obviously clicked for both of them.
Oh! We should point out that the ad mentions that the BlackBerry KEY2 is on sale for a limited time. At Best Buy , the 64GB KEY2 in Black is priced at $579.99 for a $70 discount. That is the same price for the Silver KEY2 at Amazon , with the Black model listed at $605.97 (a discount of $44.02). Keep in mind that the BlackBerry did not spread the love around with this model. The device is compatible with GSM carriers only like AT&T and T-Mobile.
What the ad didn't show was what happened after dinner ended; the man got to one knee and popped the big question. "Will we see the KEY3 at MWC later this month?"
