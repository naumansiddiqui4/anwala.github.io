Travelers can take trips on board any reserved service, with some of the best deals for two starting at just $29 to travel from Portland, Maine to Boston and at $39 to travel from Detroit to Chicago.
Two customers can also travel together in coach for $69 from Chicago to Kansas City, for $83 from Boston to New York City, for $90 from Washington, D.C. to Charlotte, or for $96 from New York City to Washington, D.C. Trips for two from Washington, D.C. to Orlando and from Chicago to New Orleans are also available for $135.

The one-way deals are available across all reserved service, so tickets on unreserved service, including on the Pennsylvanian, Keystone Service, Capitol Corridor, or the Hiawatha Service won't apply for the promotion. There are also no blackout dates for the travel period, making it easy to plan when works best to depart as a duo. 
Discounts will automatically be applied to standard fare prices, though each pair of travelers are expected to be on the same trip and booked under the same reservation.
