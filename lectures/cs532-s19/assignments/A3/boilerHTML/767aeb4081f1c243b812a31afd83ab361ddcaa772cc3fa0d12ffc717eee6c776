Tomorrow
Wednesday, February 27, 2019 - Find your happy spot and flee there, post haste! Thankfully, this can be a swift mental journey in your imagination with a little practice. However, try to also venture out into the world and visit a place that you love to go on your own, perhaps a favorite park, bookstore, museum, or restaurant. You likely have a lot on your mind and need the alone time to settle your thoughts. Plus, treating yourself to a clandestine mini-date is always a fun thing to do. Go ahead, no one needs to find out! A secret indulgence is an elixir for your soul.
