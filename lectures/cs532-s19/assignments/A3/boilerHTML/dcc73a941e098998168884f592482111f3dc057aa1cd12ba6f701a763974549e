Pledging to my Patreon is an ongoing monthly commitment to the production of content, not a one-off payment for something that catches the eye.  As a supporter you won't have to depend on random discovery of content; I'll always provide my MOST SEXY and entertaining CONTENT TO YOU DIRECTLY, whether by email or directly on the Patreon Wall/Feed.  Thank you for helping me do what I LOVE!!
Regarding Snapchat - Important: I DO NOT READ OR ADD FROM COMMUNITY TAB. PLEASE MESSAGE ME YOUR SNAPCHAT USERNAME ON PATREON. (DM).
CHEERS LOVE, YOU NEED AMMO
Kaitlyn (aka Amouranth) is a costume designer, model, character entertainer, and entrepreneur based in Houston, TX. She began her cosplay journey as a self-taught costumer in 2010. Eventually she was discovered by the Houston Grand Opera and Houston Ballet and employed in their costuming departments. She started attending conventions to combine her love of art and all things geek. Since then she's learned to work with a variety of crafting materials, including leather, worbla, resin, and even winds her own chainmail on a homemade mandrel. She welcomes challenging designs with open arms and is not afraid to dive into completely new territory when it comes to expanding her craft.
In 2015 she took her skills learned from cosplaying and started her own character company called A Charmed Affair. Over the past year it has flourished into a profitable enterprise.  She's a firm believer in following your dreams and doing what you love for a living. Since the debut of her company, she's been featured on local news stations a number of times and appeared on Discovery Network's TLC's "The Little Couple" twice, spreading magic through television screens all over the globe.

I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT
I am a Cosplayer, Streamer at Twitch.tv/amouranth , YouTuber and Entrepreneur (founder of A Charmed Affair: Houston Princess Party).  I LOVE CREATING AND SHARING MY CONTENT and being on Patreon doesn’t change that! You do not have to support me on Patreon –if what I do speaks to you then following and sharing my stream, pictures or videos are more than enough!
Patreon is aimed at my SUPER FANS (cue the crickets ?) If you want access to some super exclusive stuff and private hangouts then THIS IS FOR YOU!  And as a bonus you will be helping me create more awesomeness for you and everyone else.   As a Patron you will be helping me make THE CONTENT YOU DESERVE, but not the one I can afford... yet!
If you sign up to be a Patron you can look forward to….
GOOGLE HANGOUT SESSIONS
Super exclusive google hangouts where we can watch films, anime, play games or just talk.  Get to know the real me.  I can also show up as whatever character you’d like ;)
ACCESS TO SNAPCHAT AND EXCLUSIVE BEHIND THE SCENES PHOTOS
Want to see what my next cosplay is before I reveal it to everyone else?  Find out what super-secret projects I’m working on or get up-to-the minute updates on what I’m doing?  I’ll share them with my Patrons before anyone else along with plenty of classified snapchat awesomeness!
GAME SUGGESTIONS
Have a classic or new game suggestion?  Something that other people overlook or can’t appreciate?  Feel free to suggest it/or have me play with you!
CHOOSE MY NEXT COSPLAY AND WHO I STREAM AS

MONTHLY PERSONALIZED PRINTS

Twitch
In addition to Patreon, you can also support me on Twitch! I stream daily unless otherwise stated, usually in various cosplays! My games range from Overwatch, to Pokemon, to Diablo, to Skyrim, and more! Feel free to come hang out, chat, and listen to my sometimes drunken singing! WHOOO
