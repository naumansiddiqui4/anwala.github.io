Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are spending their first Valentine's Day together as a married couple!
Miley wished her new husband Happy Valentine's Day with a super NSFW message.
Liam is recovering from kidney stones, which caused him to miss the Grammy Awards as well as the premiere of his new movie, Isn't It Romantic .
Happy Valentine's Day to everyone except the mass amount of chocolates I will surely regret eating later! And truly, a special shoutout to Miley Cyrus, who wished her husband Liam Hemsworth a happy Valentine's Day in the most NSFW way she possibly could. With this gem:

Say it with me: It's just Miley being Miley.
Despite the blatant thirst happening up there ^, the newlyweds are presumably having a pretty laid back time. As of Sunday, Liam was in the hospital due to kidney stones, and he was too sick to attend his movie premiere earlier this week (it's cool, Miley went for him ).
Hopefully, this dude is back at home in time for the most ~romantic~ day of the year.
