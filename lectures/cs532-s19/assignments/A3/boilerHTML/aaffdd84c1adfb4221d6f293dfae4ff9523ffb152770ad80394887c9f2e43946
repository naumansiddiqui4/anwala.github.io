[TRAITORS]
New talking points being pushed backing away from Mueller as the savior re: excuse A, excuse B, excuse C?
Why are *new* investigations by [ AS ] being started, if, as he's stated for almost (2) years, 'evidence' exists that ties POTUS to Russia?
If they had evidence, do you think it would have leaked?
If they had evidence, would they be backing away (playing down) the Mueller report about to be released?

Now they claim the SC didn't look deep enough?
IF THE SC REPORT IS CLASSIFIED - HOW DO THEY KNOW WHERE, WHO, WHEN, WHY, AND HOW DEEP EACH CASE …………..?
IF THE SC REPORT IS CLASSIFIED - HOW DO THEY KNOW THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE REPORT?
Are *new* investigations designed to be an 'insurance' extension?
Designed to prevent POTUS from CLEANING HOUSE?
Attack on political opponent(s) who is/are actively conducting (leading) investigations into the President for XYZ charges beyond Mueller for XYZ reasons (zero evidence to support) - OBSTRUCTION TRAP?
[ SDNY ] opening 'private' investigation for the sole purpose of FINDING A CRIME?

Does [ SDNY ] report to AG BARR?
Watch the news.
[ MW ] opening *new* investigations into the 'finances' of POTUS and/or his family?
Why did D's state 'things will calm down if we retake the House' prior to the midterm elections?
Was their plan to retake the House in order to 'chair' each respective committee in order to start *new* erroneous investigations in an attempt to retain the BLOCKADE?
Retain the 'insurance' policy?
Retain the optical illusion that a crime was committed?
Retain the narrative?
