My temp’s not high but, just in case
I’ll take the cold meds
Go to the KOTATSU, heads
You can’t get out but, warming
The cat turns round. How about the dog?
I know next to nothing about it
Winter’s too chill
I roll up my sleeves, and my arms are too chill
My limbs are getting stiff
Winter’s too freezin
I roll up my sleeves, and my arms are too freezin
I was shiverin
YOU***E has too many thumbnails like this, so
there’s too many and even this video’s like this, so…
Winter’s too chill
I roll up my sleeves, and my arms are too chill
My limbs are getting stiff
Winter’s too freezin
I roll up my sleeves, and my arms are too freezin
I was shiverin
Exchanging the blanket cover is too much work
It’s too much work so, someone do something about that
There isn’t anything more I want to say, to ask, no more
No I do
My family is an organization in the scale of three thousand
We lick knives every day, so we’re less prone to anemia
We’re never absent, we love being healthy, we don’t do dangerous things
I’ve never insulted anyone, never will, never have
I have before
I don’t want to lie
I rap like that
Wrap my feelings with transparency
Act like I don’t know
Refrigerate then microwave
My temp’s not high but, just in case
I’ll take the cold meds
Go to the KOTATSU, heads
You can’t get out but, warming
I rap like that
Wrap my feelings with transparency
Act like I don’t know
Refrigerate then microwave
My temp’s not high but, just in case
I’ll take the cold meds
What I need is your breath
That’s the only thing that’ll keep me from freezing
