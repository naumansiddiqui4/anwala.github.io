SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- What’s different about the newest entertainment venue that took over the former bowling alley space at Destiny USA?
“Everything,” said Lisa Napelitano, of Apex Entertainment.
Apex Entertainment has remodeled the 55,000-square-feet venue on the third level of Destiny USA’s Canyon Area that originally housed Revolutions and most recently was the home to All-Star Alley & Tavern, which closed in August 2018.
Napelitano took Syracuse.com on a sneak peek tour of the entertainment venue which is set to open later this month.
Apex, which currently has a location in Massachusetts, features virtual reality simulators, a two-level laser tag arena, bowling, arcade games, bumper cars, shuffle board and more. The venue also includes a bar and full-service kitchen, which will serve American-style cuisine, such as burgers, sandwiches and shareable appetizers.
The venue also has rooms available for kid’s birthday parties to corporate events and everything in between. It’s largest room can also host a wedding reception, Napelitano said.
