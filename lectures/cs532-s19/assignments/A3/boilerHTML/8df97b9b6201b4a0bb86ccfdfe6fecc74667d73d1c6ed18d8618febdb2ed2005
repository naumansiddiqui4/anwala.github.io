Tomorrow
Wednesday, February 27, 2019 - You make like a bumble bee today, and get out and about. You buzz -- literally or digitally -- from place to place, gathering the latest news, and sharing what you learn with those who need to know. Each encounter enlivens you and charges you up for the next one. By the end of the day, you will have more than enough pollen to scrape off your feet. You maintain rich connections with these forays into the social field. You could even write a novel or screenplay about it all when you return to your hive. Spread kindness everywhere you land.
