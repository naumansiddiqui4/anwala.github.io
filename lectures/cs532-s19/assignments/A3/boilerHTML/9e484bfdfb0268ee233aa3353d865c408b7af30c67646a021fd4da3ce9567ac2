The interesting thing about data is that you don’t have to be a data scientist or know the difference between databases to be data literate. Being data literate is having the ability to drive meaningful information from data. The part that is up for interpretation is the meaningful information. What looks useful to data scientists will most likely mean nothing to a sales executive and vice versa. However, both parties have much to gain from data. So how do you, a business manager in an organization overseeing different teams with different goals, ensure that all your employees are data literate?
First, let’s be clear about two things: 1) Data can be understood by anyone with the right tools/training, and 2) encouraging a data-literate workforce is easier than you think. However, a recent study shows that only 20% of business leaders consider themselves data literate. This translates into a workforce that has limited access to data tools and knowledge. According to a recent Gartner report , one of the most significant roadblocks to progress is poor data literacy.
Managers should strive to be data-something. Whether you want to be able to become data-driven and speak to your analysts without batting an eyelash or become data-informed to understand the essentials, any operational or business decision you make will be based on data in some way or another. It’s been said before and it will be said again: Big data is here to stay. Thankfully, it is now a language we can all speak: “Which part of this information is useful for me and my goals?”
So how does this translate into making valid business decisions? Offering your business team the right tools they need in order to make data part of their daily workflow is closer than you think. The digital tools are immeasurable. There are now online classes, platforms and services that, with the right training, allow your employees to cut through the noise and clearly find the information that they need.
Here are some tips for help you get started:
• Make data a priority: Data, and data literacy, should be something that all your employees are aware of. In other words, it needs to become part of the business. By making data literacy a common goal, you will increase employee engagement and increase data-driven mindsets.
• Make data accessible:In order to increase data literacy in your workforce, it has to be within arm’s reach. Start by classifying and establishing a structure that will recognize data that is useful for any and all employees, and make it available through the organization’s platforms.
• Start small:Rome wasn’t built in a day, and your data workforce won’t be either. By steadying the pace, you will be able to ensure the right tools and measures are in place in order to see solid results. This, in turn, will motivate employees to engage and believe in the process.
• Less is more: Simply put, if your chosen data platforms are too complex and intimidating, your workforce won’t engage. Depending on your resources, you can choose to branch the data for • different departments or install in-house systems that will automatically make integration a simple process.
So, what does this mean for your business? Let’s say, for example, that you work for a company that wants to market new headphones to a younger audience. There are a few key factors that you, as a manager, must know in order to strategically design and implement a marketing strategy. Will the product appeal to all genders? Will the branding be different for men and women? Will the product be inexpensive so that the younger crowd will be able to afford it? Will the price repel older customers?
Start by channeling the late W. Edwards Deming : “In God we trust, all others bring data.” Deming promoted a data work cycle that is applicable throughout your entire organization: plan, do, check, act.
• Determine the objective:What information are you looking for, and how is it going to be measured? This will not only help you cut through the noise, but will make reaching KPIs and the passing of information either to your team or your superiors a gentle process.
• Organization is key:In essence, data is another language altogether. So if you don’t understand the language, start by organizing your data. Eventually, you will create a set that is legible and clear. Don’t try to make decisions by looking at something that you don’t understand.
• Visualize your data: Do you see growth? Do you see product development? Do you see a different workflow than you anticipated? As you try to make sense of your data, visualize the steps in your head.
• Welcome change: Don’t be afraid to go back to square one. Part of making data-informed decisions is understanding that you may have to dust yourself off and try again. Act on the results and the information you see. Don’t avoid making necessary changes because it could mean a huge difference.
It’s important to remember that there are people entering your organization who are not only data literate, but data fluent. There are countless people throughout any organization, big or small, whose job is to understand the data. Bridging the gap between what an employee brings into the organization and how they can communicate with other departments starts with introducing a shared language among your different employees.
Your data-literate workforce will have the ability to comprehend data insights and formulate better decisions based on this knowledge. In his book Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap…and Others Don’t, Jim Collins addresses the importance of a dependable workforce, stating that “great vision without great people is irrelevant.” By investing in data literacy, employees will be better suited to make wiser business decisions, which can help improve overall productivity and employee satisfaction.
