'He's been placed on antibiotics for 10 days but it was quite a deep infection so we'll let him come back in his own time. He won't run again until he is well enough to run.
'It's unlikely that he'll run again this season, but not out of the question.'
If a recovered Samco was to run this season, the only possible option for him would probably the Punchestown Festival at the start of May.
Meanwhile, Yorkshire trainer Jedd O'Keeffe believes the new plastic padded hurdles which have replaced the traditional birch hurdles at Ascot this season may have the reason why leading staying hurdler Sam Spinner jumped so waywardly at the Berkshire track's pre-Christmas fixture.
Sam Spinner was very hesitant at the first flight of the Long Walk Hurdle, which he had won on 2017, and unseated jockey Joe Colliver at the second flight.
O'Keeffe said: 'We are still guessing and making assumptions but for some reason he took an instant dislike to the Ascot hurdles. He has never taken a dislike to an obstacle before.
'It was the first time he had raced over the padded hurdles and, Joe said, with sun behind them they looked very bright. He has had in schooling session since and to start with you could tell his confidence had been knocked. But he quickly got back in his rhythm.'
O'Keeffe is aiming to get Sam Spinner back on course in the Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham on January 26.
