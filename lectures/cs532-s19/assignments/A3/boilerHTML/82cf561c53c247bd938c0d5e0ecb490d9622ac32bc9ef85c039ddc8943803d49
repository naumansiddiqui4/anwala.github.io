Aerosmith, the classic rock band, has been kidnapped and it's your responsibility to free them. Operating from a first-person perspective, you must blast anything or anyone who crosses your path. Pick up your musical sonic assault weapon and get ready for the time of your life. The breathtaking arcade smash has come home in Revolution X.
Revolution X is a rail shooter in which the players must shoot targets including NON soldiers and vehicles, with the ultimate goal of rescuing the band. Players start the game at Club X in Los Angeles, first fighting the NON troops inside and then stealing a helicopter to fly across the city and find Aerosmith's car. They must then destroy three NON facilities in the Amazon jungle, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. These three stages may be played in any order; however, failing to complete the Middle East stage within a set time limit will send the players back to its start for another attempt. Finally, the players advance to Wembley Stadium for the final battle with the surviving NON forces and Head Mistress Helga, who transforms into a giant roaring creature that fires machine guns, bazookas and grenades. Throughout the game, objects can be shot that may reveal power-ups like health-replenishing shakes, CD's, powerful laserdiscs and Super Guns, Skull Bombs and shields. Players can also find hostages and free them throughout the game for extra points.
