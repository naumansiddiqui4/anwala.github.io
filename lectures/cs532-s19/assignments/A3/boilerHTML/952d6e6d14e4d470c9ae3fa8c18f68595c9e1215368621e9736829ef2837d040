Disclaimer: This piece is also known as Mariage D'amoure by Paul de Senneville. ''Chopin - Spring Waltz'' is just a pseudonym. Chopin hasn't written this piece. I uploaded this piece when I, just like you, didn't know the truth that this piece is not by Chopin! But... Unfortunately, if I'll change the name of this video to the correct one, other videos with name "Chopin Spring Waltz" will rise on top(there's hundreds of them!), so I put this disclaimer on top of description of the most popular video. I truly didn't want to pour misinformation around. I'm genuinely sorry for inconveniences it caused to you... :(
