Former 2NE1 member Park Bom will be making a solo comeback with a new song next month.
According to news media outlets, Park Bom has confirmed that she will be releasing her new song in March and that she is in the final stages of preparations for the comeback. This will be the first time making a comeback in 8 years since her last single “Don’t Cry” in 2011.
 
Park Bom made her debut in 2009 as the main vocal of the girl group, 2NE1. After releasing a solo album and single in 2009 and 2011 respectively, she ultimately decided to go off on her own in 2016.
