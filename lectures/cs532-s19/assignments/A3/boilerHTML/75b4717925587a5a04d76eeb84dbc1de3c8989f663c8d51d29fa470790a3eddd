Congratulations! You’ve survived monster attacks and made it safely to Camp Half-Blood, the training camp for Greek demigods. What’s that? You don’t know where to stow your gear? Don’t worry—the Hermes cabin will take you in. You can bunk there until you’ve been claimed by your godly parent.

Just don’t blame me if you don’t like the answer.
