Chicago Investment Properties At 30-50% Below Market Value (Handyman / Vacant / Great Rentals Available)
Serious Buyers Only Please: If you’re a cash buyer and are looking to pick up rental properties in Chicago or properties to rehab in Chicago, we’d like to work with you. Please ENTER YOUR INFO in the form to the right and we’ll send you the handyman and discount properties we currently have available. (Our list is updated 2-3 times a week, as we secure new properties and as we sell ones already on the list). 
Over the years we’ve refined our processes, marketing, and relationships that let us find the best real estate deals before they ever hit the MLS market. Our business is strictly wholesaling those properties to investors who want to keep them for rentals or who want to fix and flip them.
If you are…
An investor looking to add cash flowing properties to your rental portfolio
A rehabber looking for great deals with wide margins to fix and turn around for a profit
A person looking for a great home at a great price to live in yourself
… or just someone looking for great deals on local real estate
… get on our Buyers List with the form on the right and we’ll send you properties each month with discounts of at least 30% below market value.
NOTE: Properties are first come first served so be sure if you find a property that you’re interested in, respond back via email or phone (info once you join to the right) to make sure you get a shot at the property.
Join to the right, connect with us and let us know what you’re looking for, and we look forward to working with you on sending you insanely discounted properties in Chicago.
