Lee Hyun talked about his Big Hit Entertainment labelmate BTS . 
On the February 14 airing of KBS Radio's 'Moon Hee Jun's Music Show,' Lee Hyun was asked if BTS' immense success was expected. 
Lee Hyun replied, "I don't think anyone really knew they would become this successful, to be honest. But I've seen RM, SUGA, and j-hope since the very beginning and they were amazing. At the time, I wasn't able to make music but they were already producing. RM also wrote excellent rap lyrics, so I knew that they would do well."
