The Engle children detailed to the grand jury their years of abuse, and fear of their father. They told them how their main food supply came from their meals at school, and how they lived in their cramped, unsanitary trailer home. They testified how John ordered them to cover the ashes site–where Christopher’s body was burned–with old tires and other debris.
When it was time for the children to testify, Deputies screened them from reporters as they were led to and from the grand jury room. When two brothers passed in the hallway, one admonished the other to, “Do a good job.”
