The Crockpot takes on a holiday classic.
For a lot of families, green bean casserole is the traditional veggie dish that you have to have on your Thanksgiving table. This is a deceptively simple recipe – just green beans in a cream-soup sauce, topped with French-fried onions – but the whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts. For some reason no one can explain, the blend of creamy soup and crunchy onions elevates plain old canned green beans to the level of art.
The only problem with making this as part of your Thanksgiving meal is that there are so many other parts of the meal you have to worry about at the same time. This casserole isn’t hard to make at all, but it takes about half an hour – and it’s hard to find that half an hour when you’re busy trying to juggle turkey, stuffing, gravy, potatoes, and cranberries. In the rush to get everything onto the table at the same time, it’s easy for the veggies to slip your mind.
So, once again, the Crockpot is here to save the day. Whenever you have a spare minute, you can just mix your beans and sauce up right in the pot, sprinkle the onions on top, and put it on high. In a couple of hours, your casserole will be piping hot and topped with a gorgeous, crunchy crust. And if it turns out the rest of the meal isn’t ready at that point, the dish can sit happily on the warm setting until you need it.
In fact, the Crockpot makes this holiday recipe so easy and good, you’ll want to enjoy it all year round.
Recipe update: There has been some confusion about condensed soup vs prepared soup, so I have rewritten the recipe for just condensed soup, since this is what the majority of folks are using.
