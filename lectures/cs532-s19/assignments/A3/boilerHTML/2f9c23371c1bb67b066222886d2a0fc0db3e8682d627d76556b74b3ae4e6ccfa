It was a rough night for Jimmy Uso and his wife.
WWE star Jimmy Uso was reportedly arrested in Detroit for disorderly conduct and obstruction after allegedly trying to square up with the cops, according to TMZ Sports . The incident allegedly occurred after Uso's wife, WWE star Naomi, was pulled over for driving the wrong way on a one-way street. The cops reportedly smelled booze in the car and asked for Naomi to get out of the vehicle. That's when Uso allegedly got out of the car, took off his shirt and then squared up as if he was looking for a brawl. Eventually, the cops pulled out a taser and Uso backed off and complied with the police. 
As  TMZ reported, Uso was taken to jail but immediately made bond and has since been released.  Based on the report, it doesn't seem as though Naomi was taken into custody. Although, as any new details emerge on the incident, we will be sure to provide them for you.
Uso and his brother are a part of a tag team that is set to face off against The Miz and Shane McMahon in Houston this upcoming weekend. Uso, 33, is also the son of Rikishi who is a WWE Hall Of Fame member.
