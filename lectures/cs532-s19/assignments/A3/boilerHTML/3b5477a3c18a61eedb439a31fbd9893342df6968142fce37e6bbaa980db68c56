TO THE BREAKING POINTE IS BOOK  #2 IN THE FIRST FORCE SERIES. I READ THE FIRST BOOK IN THE SERIES AND THE SECOND BOOK WAS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST.  I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE STORY ONE BIT.  WE ARE INTRODUCED TO GRANT AND SILJA, FORMER LOVERS.  GRANT LET THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE, SILJA MOVE TO RUSSIA TO PURSUE HER DREAM OF BECOMING A DANCER.  SILJA FINDS OUT THE NOVIKOV BALLET COMPANY IS BROKE AND THAT HER BOSS, NATALIE FORCES HER DANCERS TO PROSTITUTE THEMSELVES.  AN AMERICAN FINANCIERS OFFERS TO BAIL OUT THE BALLET COMPANY IN EXCHANGE FOR SILJA BECOMING HIS PERSONAL COMPANION AND FILL ALL OF HIS PERSONAL DESIRES.  SHE IS TAKEN TO HIS MANSION AGAINST HER WILL BUT MANAGES TO GET A TEXT MESSAGE TO GRANT ASKING FOR HELP.
WHEN GRANT RECEIVES THE MESSAGE, HE RUSHES OFF TO RUSSIA TO SAVE SILJA.  WILL GRANT BE ABLE TO SAVE SILJA WITH THE HELP OF HIS FIRST FORCE TEAMMATES?  WILL THEIR PASSION BE IGNITED WHEN THEY SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN?
I LOVED GRANT AND SILJA.  BOTH WERE REALLY STRONG CHARACTERS WHO NEVER STOPPED LOVING EACH OTHER.  GRANT WOULD GO TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO SAVE SILJA.  YOU COULD FEEL HOW DEEPLY THEIR FEELINGS WERE FOR ONE ANOTHER.  TO THE BREAKING POINTE IS FILLED WITH ALOT OF ACTION, SUSPENSE AND ROMANCE.  THE AUTHOR DRAWS YOU INTO THE STORY AND HOLDS YOUR ATTENTION TO THE VERY END.  YOU ARE KEPT GUESSING THROUGHOUT THE STORY WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT AND THERE WERE SOME SURPRISES.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SERIES.  I REALLY ENJOYED TO THE BREAKING POINTE.  IT WAS A FAST PACED READ FOR ME. I DID NOT WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN.  I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THE NEXT BOOK IN THE SERIES.  CINDY MCDONALD HAS CREATED THE PERFECT SERIES WITH LOTS OF WONDERFUL CHARACTERS. EACH ONE HAS THEIR OWN STORY TO TELL AND HAVE EXPERIENCED DIFFERENT OBSTACLES AND TRAGEDIES THEY HAD TO OVERCOME.  FIRST FORCE FEELS MORE LIKE A FAMILY AND THEY ARE DEFINITELY ARE A TEAM.  THEY HAVE EACH OTHERS BACKS.
CINDY MCDONALD HAS BECOME ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ MORE OF HER BOOKS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU READ THIS SERIES.  YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MISSING.
