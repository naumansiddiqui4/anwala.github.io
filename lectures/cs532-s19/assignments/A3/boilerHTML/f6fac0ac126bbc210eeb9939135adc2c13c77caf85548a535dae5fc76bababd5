Description:
She responds to Titi. She lost her collar that we now have, and has a clearly defined line down her nose that splits her face into two colors. She also has tufts on her ears and paws and she's relatively short-legged. She was lost in Coolidge but got a ride to Gilbert and we haven't seen her since. Her collar was found near E Calle Del Norte Dr & S Parkcrest St, Gilbert.
