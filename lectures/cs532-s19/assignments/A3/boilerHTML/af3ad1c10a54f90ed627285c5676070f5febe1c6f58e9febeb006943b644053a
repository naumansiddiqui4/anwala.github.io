Monitor and Analyse
Unfollowspy aggregates followers data and after seven days of being a member will display metrics about how many people have followed or unfollowed your social media account.
This data is ideal for keeping tabs on your social media growth and seeing if your brand or topic page is on the rise or decline.
Manage Audience
Track all the latest people to follow your social media account in real time with our live reports. You can log in and view your new friends, view people who've unfollowed or followed you and see people who you don't follow back and vice versa.
You can view full details on these users in-app and follow back or unfollow these accounts if you wish.
Schedule Tweets / Content
You can post tweets at any date over the coming two months automatically using our scheduled tweets tool. Just enter the tweet text and the timezone you wish to post the tweet in, and we'll do the rest for you.
Never forget to post that promotional tweet or special wish for a loved one again.
Locate Inactive or Spam Followers
You can scan through your friend's list and locate users that haven't tweeted within a specified period for example 1 month, six months, one year etc. We will then present you with a list of these users, and you can remove them if you wish.
You can also search for low-quality spammy accounts that don't have a profile picture and remove these.
