This may have already been thought of/discussed, but Gauntlets are a good use of Perk Up. Since when u die/fail it restarts u with all 8 perks so u get to maximize the usage of your bonus perks with a single elixir use.
Plus if you have Dying wish, that’s multiple more times you can essentially die without losing your extra perks. Also, since you can’t get free perks from the challenges/Viking funeral pyre, it is the only option for extra perks.
**Edit: Nvm, I guess u only keep the extra  perks if u fail a round, not if u die. I could have sworn the 1st time I used one I died and restarted with all 8 perks but I just accidentally used an anywhere but here on  “defend the arena” rd (so dumb) and it killed me for leaving the arena and I only restarted with 4 perks.
