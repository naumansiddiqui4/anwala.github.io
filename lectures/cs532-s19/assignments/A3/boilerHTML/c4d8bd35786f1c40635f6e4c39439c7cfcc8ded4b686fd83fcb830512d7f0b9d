Song Mino and P.O who gained a lot of attention for their friendship lately
They've been friends for 11 years, since their high school days
They talked about their first impression of each other..
Song Mino said that they just happened to get attracted to each other
P.O said that Song Mino looked like a Pokemon (on their first encounter) because of his blonde hair and his yellow long padding..ㅋㅋ
Hearing that, Song Mino explained that there's this guy (P.O) who were really popular and gained a lot of friends in the enrollment ceremony.
Which he found was very annoying..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
And then they tested out their friendship
'Would you give up the girl you like just for your friend?'
Song Mino answered yes and P.O answered no..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Song Mino stared at P.O..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
And said, 'Wait a sec. Let's turn off the cameras for a second'ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
These guys are really best friends..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
That's the thing that you can only say to your best friendsㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
