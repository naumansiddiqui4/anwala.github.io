Tumor Feast was a grindcore trio that I had the opportunity to record their demo.  Their music was definately not for the faint hearted.  With a blastbeat promising to blow your fucking head off.  This video of their live show at Sudsy Malones (3/5/04) lasted a little less than ten minutes, but did not waiver when it came to the energy given off by their performance.  I had so much fun recording this band because of its raw form and straight up "I Don't Give a Fuck" attitude.  I hope for anyone that are into this type of music can be easily inspired especially to those bands that want to pursue this genre of music.
