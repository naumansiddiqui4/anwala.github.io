I really like this company. I try to avoid animal products and these vegan shoes have great style, good price, and, as I mention in the headline, fit nicely for a flat-footed sneaker. I mangled my feet by wearing vegan Saucony bullet sneakers for too long. It wasn't the fault of the shoe -- just me for overdoing it. Saucony sneakers have zero arch support and they give out after multiple daily wears. I feel a little more support in these. I wouldn't wear them everyday as they probably aren't intended for that. So, if you go vegan and light-footed you have to have a few rotating pairs of shoes. I'll count this as one of them. (i also bought the Gatsby, which I likeâ€¦.) I don't know how they'll hold up in time -- only had them a week-plus -- and I doubt they'll withstand serious sports or ball playing. But for urban luggers, these do really well.
