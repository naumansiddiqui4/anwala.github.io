Finding Furever Homes
FFH is a small UK registered charity, working hard to help dogs find FUREVER Homes.
We have dogs in kennels as well as in foster with families and details of each can be found on our ADOPT ME page.
We also try to help support smaller dog rescues located throughout the UK by marketing, raising awareness, fundraising, home checking and offering help and support in whatever way we can, when time and funds allow.
Finding Furever Homes are currently looking for a new home themselves. In order to look after dogs that need that little extra - dogs like Maximus, Frazer, Rocky ... we need to find new premises to carry on doing our work. We will be without a home at the end of February so if you can help us or know someone who can, please share our details with them? What we are looking for is here ..... Premises required Thank you :-)
We hold regular fundraisers throughout the UK and online via social media to raise funds for kennelling, vets fees, transport and to provide post adoption support from a qualified and experienced trainer and behaviourist. Furever is what matters most.
Our priority is the dogs and we do our best to find the best match for them, sometimes it takes a little longer with certain dogs than others, but FFH never gives up on a dog, in any way.
As well as looking for fantastic homes, we are always on the look out for volunteers to help fundraise, homecheck, transport, dog walk and even just provide admin support or help with social media campaigns.
