Dita’s Donation Drop – thank you for your support!
$15.00
Thank you for your overwhelming support with this donation drive. Our Dita’s Donation Drop supporters brought in a total of 664 toys that will be sent to active duty military working dogs! Thank you to my supporters for your generosity and thank you to  USA-K9  for matching each toy that you donated. Stay tuned, more donation opportunities will be available later in the year. Follow @ditathehairmissile and @MWDTSA on IG to see our MWD toy recipients.
