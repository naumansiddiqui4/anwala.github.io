Internet Archive's Save Page Now feature has introduced a beta version that requires users to login to be able to use it. However, it comes with some additional optional features such as "Save outlinks", "Save error pages (HTTP Status=4xx, 5xx)", "Save also in my web archive", and allows supplying credentials for password protected web-pages. I have not tried it, so I don't know whether these credentials are used as HTTP Basic Auth or detect proper login forms and fill those in.

This impacts ArchiveNow, so attention Mohamed. This might also be relevant to Mat's work.
