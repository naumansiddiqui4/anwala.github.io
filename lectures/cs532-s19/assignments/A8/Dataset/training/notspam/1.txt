Mike welcomes you to Hampton Roads Hikers
Thanks for joining Hampton Roads Hikers. The group provides a broad scope of events. Some walks are very easy(guided walking tours), others are moderately challenging and others still are meant to challenge the most athletic members. 

Everyone is friendly and we love new members.

Please make time to RSVP and participate. Feel the benefits of what the club experiences offer through Nature, Exercise and Socializing.

New members can RSVP and attend events during the 2-week trial without being obligated to pay the dues. You can even RSVP for events 2 weeks beyond your trail as long as the RSVP is submitted during the trial period.
