RevolutionConf is back in Virginia Beach on June 6th and 7th!
Hey all!

RevolutionConf is back for it's fourth year - and you're invited to join us!

For the past three years, RevolutionConf has aimed to show people that the Hampton Roads region is home to some of the best tech talent in the country - and you’re a part of that. RevolutionConf is tech agnostic - so we really don’t care of you’re a JavaScript person, .NET person, Java person, Ruby person, or… you get it. If you sling code or work in software development, you’re the type of person we want to teach and learn from at RevolutionConf.

And since you’re a member of 757dev, it’s vitally important to us that we have your support. Without you, this community could not exist. By being at RevolutionConf, you’re helping us show the country that we’re one of the best regions in the country for tech.

Take a few minutes to look at our lineup at https://revolutionconf.com. It’s pretty impressive, if I do say so myself. Additionally, we’re hosting four half-day workshops on Docker, Python, Data Structures, and Shell Scripting! Whether you’re new to the industry, or a seasoned pro - there is something for everyone.

On April 1st, our pricing will go up to it’s final rate. We’d love to lock you in before that happens. However, I know how email can be - so if you’re reading this after the 1st, hit reply and I’ll hook you up with a good discount.

Grab your ticket TODAY at .

We are also offering a Diversity Scholarship for underrepresented folks in technology. You’re welcome to apply at https://diversity.revolutionconf.com. The scholarship is open until May 1st, 2019.

And as always, we’re open to sponsorship if you or your company wants to exhibit or send a large group. Let us know if we can help!

I can't wait to see you there!
