Hello there,

Paul and Rodrigo from the Gradle team here.

We wanted to invite you to a training webinar we are hosting - Getting Started with the Gradle Kotlin DSL.

This class will help you understand the key concepts of the Gradle Kotlin DSL, which leverages the Kotlin language and provides good tooling for a productive build-logic authoring and maintenance experience. The static nature of Kotlin enables both compile time checking and authoring assistance from your IDE, from auto-completion to refactoring and everything in-between.

You can register here for the webinar on April 12th at 10am PDT / 7pm CET and we will send a video recording to everyone that registers after the session.

We hope you will join us!

Cheers,
Paul Merlin
Lead Software Engineer @ Gradle

Rodrigo Oliviera
Principal Software Engineer @Gradle
