Live and Learn in the City
The University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee provides much more than an on-campus education. The city of Milwaukee can connect you to endless opportunities to learn and have fun outside of the classroom. It’s so easy to get around town to take advantage of all the city has to offer, and we’ve got your ride covered.

Students enrolled at UWM get a Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) bus pass that will allow you to travel all over Milwaukee County—free of charge. Need to get to your internship? Want to attend one of our downtown festivals? Want to go shopping? The MCTS can get you there, for FREE.
