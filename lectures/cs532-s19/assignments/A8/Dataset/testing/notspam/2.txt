Dear MOHAMMED SIDDIQUE,

We have noticed that your Corporate Salary Account has neither received salary credit nor maintained Average Monthly Balance (AMB) for MAR 19. We request you to please credit salary or maintain the required balance in APR 19 to avoid application of Non Maintenance Charges (NMC) for MAR 19 and APR 19.Alternatively you may visit the nearest branch and convert your account to NMC waived Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account. 

To know the required AMB for your Account variant, the associated NMC charges and the NMC policy effective April 2015, please refer to the General Schedule of Features and Charges (GSFC) on www.kotak.com.

Regards 
Corporate Salary Desk
