Hi Everyone, 
We meet at Rite Aid at Shore Drive and Great Neck. 
The weather looks good for the hike at First Landing Saturday at 11am. This hike is meant to be challenging, so come prepared for a very brisk and somewhat hilly 8 mile walk. 

If your plans have changed please switch your rsvp to “no” at the top right of the event page. So people on the waitlist can go. 

Here is a link to the meeting place
