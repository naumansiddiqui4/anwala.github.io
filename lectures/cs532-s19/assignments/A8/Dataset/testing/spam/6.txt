Unfortunately, today is the day…

 

I need you to confirm that you still want to receive emails from me by clicking this link:

 

Click This Link TO let me know you want to keep hearing from me…

 

…or you will be removed from our mailing list in 24 hours.

 

(Sorry if that comes off sound harsh, but I really only want to mail people who actually want to hear from me.)

 

Originally you subscribed to my newsletter because you wanted  information about GRE, TOEFL, F1 Visa, H1b Visa, Jobs Search, etc.

 

Interests change…

 

Priorities change…

 

People change…

 

If your interests and priorities have changed, no hard feelings. Just unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of this email and I won’t bug you anymore.

 

But if you are still interested in [insert known benefits and desired end results] and I simply slipped through the cracks somehow, you need to TAKE ACTION TODAY.

 

It’s simple…

 

Just CLICK HERE and your subscription will automatically be re-activated.

 

 

 

Talk soon (hopefully),

Raghuram.
