<u>WILSON FAMILY TALES</u><br />
<br />
My dad was born in Philadelphia to Thomas Francis Wilson, Sr. and Anna May Kelly. I will now discuss the long and treacherous journey the Wilsons made into the new age, and how the implications of this slime-covered trek through the muck still affect our daily lives today.<br />
<br />
Thomas Francis Wilson, Sr. and his life are the subject of many mystical and fantastical tales, which are somehow entirely verifiable and true. He was born in 1924 to a blonde-haired WWI Sergeant named George, and an Irish mother named Lelia. He had 4 siblings: George, John, Mary, and Joseph. They were a regular Depression-era Catholic brood if you ever did see one, residing in the riverside town of Bristol, PA. The Wilsons, those being George's siblings and parents, by all accounts were fair-haired and not very nice. They were originally Irish as well, with a history of fathers abandoning their families or otherwise being troublemakers. Great-grandfather George did not intend to be an exception. He ran a small store, which held gambling in the back room. In the cellar at home, George put young Tom to work bottling grain alcohol, or "root beer". George took his wife Lelia on trips into the city to transport this grain alcohol, during the time we know as Prohibition. Yessir, this fella was a bootlegger. Well, it came to be that a wife and five kids was too much for the slick George Wilson. He skipped town, leaving Lelia with the children. After looking to the other Wilsons for help and being roundly turned away, Lelia resolved to leave her kids in the care of Catholic nuns at an orphanage, with the exception of young Mary and Joe. Mary went from one foster home to the next, where she was not treated with much care at all. Joe simply went to a different place before being old enough to go to the parish with George, John, and Tom. Such was the fate of many fatherless children during the Depression.<br />
Tom did not hate the orphanage. Everyone was equal there; black, white, whatever. Your peers were your "chums", in orphan parlance. Of course, Christmas and your birthday were not bountiful in terms of presents. You would receive a washcloth and a toothbrush for Christmas, and, well, nothing for your birthday. Tom had his first birthday cake at age 21. That, he bought himself.<br />
Anyway, Tom made his way through high school, and wasn't quite sure what to do next. His brothers served in WWII, but he was 4-F due to an issue with his ear. He did, however, serve in the PA National Guard. I forgot to mention that Grandfather was tall. For his Nat'l Guard uniform, he had to wear officer beige, as they had no green uniforms in his size. Everyone kept saluting him.<br />
Tom's brother George, upon coming home from the war, went to work for an interesting man named Marcel Viti. Viti was a lawyer, and a professional of the caliber you might only find in the Old Guard. Tom went to work for Viti as an apprentice, and soon became interested in studying law. Marcel Viti convinced him to pursue this, convincing which included paying for his education.<br />
Law school was hard, but Tom persevered and became a practicing attorney. Around then is when he met Anna May Kelly (our Nana). She was an Irish girl, and 12 years his junior. He said to himself, <i>she's too young for me.</i>&nbsp;Time went by, and they started dating anyhow, and got married in 1958.<br />
<br />
Nana was born in 1936 to an Irish carpenter named Edward Joseph Kelly Sr., and a German-Irish mother, also named Anna May. She had two siblings: a sister, Kay Kelly, and a brother, Edward Jr. She grew up in Reading, PA, then eventually moved to the city of Philadelphia. She liked to go into the city on an elevated train and visit the corner bakeries and other shops. These are usually termed "the good old days". Edward Sr. grew up in the mountains of Pennsylvania, working in coal mines and rat-infested factories. In his adult years, he was tough and had a short temper. He was known for throwing things in a pure Irish rage. Anna May (the Elder) was an expert seamstress, saintly, and also called Nana in her later days. Anyway, young Anna May was a talker from the very start, and never had trouble finding friends, the wrong type though they may have sometimes been.<br />
<br />
So we come to the year 1958. Tom and Anna May are married and live in Philadelphia together. In typical "Baby Boomer" fashion, they proceed to have five kids and move to Villanova, a nice little residential area off the Main Line. My dad was one of these youth, and he had four siblings: Tom Jr., Brian <i>Marcel, </i>Anna May (III), and Jane Marie.<br />
Tom Jr. was a skinny and nerdy youth with asthma. In school, he was a tuba player (with asthma), and bullied quite a lot. After high school, he developed the acting bug and went to school for theater. Then, he started doing stand-up comedy. Then, he was in a number of notable films, including the entire&nbsp;<i>Back to the Future </i>series. Then, he was in Spongebob. Anyways, you can just read his Wikipedia page for his other credits. Today, he visits about once a year with his blonde Californian wife &amp; four, blonde Californian children by his side. They are named Anna May, Emily, Gracie, and Tommy (III). Uncle Tom and I speak with deep voices about deep stuff, then we laugh and joke around. Then, he goes home and paints big paintings.<br />
Brian <i>Marcel</i>&nbsp;is the tallest Wilson child. As a youth, he played lots of lacrosse. He married once, had a daughter named Kelly, then got divorced. Brian is a frugal and shrewd gentleman (and thrifty), always looking for crafty ways of making his life easier and more efficient. He was also one of the "fun" Uncles during childhood, who drove you around or took you to the Zoo. Today, he's a part-time lacrosse coach who takes care of our Nana.<br />
Anna May is the tallest Wilson daughter, and third Anna May in a row. As a teenager she sang in rock bands, and was compared to Anne Wilson from Heart. I mean, they have the same name and both sing in rock bands. She married Paul, and had a son, Paul. Paul Sr. proved to be emotionally and physically distant as a father, so Anna May left him after a short marriage. She later married Uncle Chris(py), an outdoorsman and deranged chaser of fun. They had Danielle and Benjamin. Danielle is the same age as me and goes to the same school that I do. In this way, we are cousin-counterparts. I'm better. I always have and always will be.<br />
(skipping dad for a minute)<br />
Jane Marie is the shortest Wilson daughter. Jane was a professional singer for some time, starting in college. She's got a big voice. She has an iron resolve and commanding personality (the good kind), brought about from her essentially taking care of her parents (and grandparents) in just her teen years. "Aunt Janie" also works at Microsoft, and will crush you.<br />
So, we come to G. L. Zippy O'Rourke O'Shoughnassy Wilson.<br />
<br />
<u>PAPPY</u><br />
<u><br /></u>
My dad, Geoffrey Lawrence Wilson, is a Great American.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey was the Odd Child. He was scrawny, with dark (nearly black) hair in big, dopey curls. He jumped off roofs, hit his head multiple times, and cultivated a gap in his front teeth which would be forever his greatest physical distinction. That, and his type I diabetes. Yes, at an early age Geoffrey was diagnosed with diabetes, and was from thenceforth powered by insulin and controlled, in part, by sugar and his intake of it. It is a terrifically inconvenient disease, one that draws much water in the conception I have of my father, yet one that holds no water in my father's conception of himself, life, fate, or truth. This is not borne (entirely) from eternal wisdom, this clear-eyed optimism and iron resolve. Nor is it borne from oppressive and visceral experience, like a nascent star is formed from spinning clouds. Nay, my father's will to endure, my father's survival against all odds, my father's steel-plated spiritual armor comes from one thing: his shining, golden, relentless sense of humor. My father is a natural comedian. He's a dork, a goofball, a barrel of monkeys; a barrel of monkeys with no bottom. He's humorous to a fault. In fact, some people just don't get him. Many people (government workers, etc.) simply ignore his attempts at comedy. But no one likes government workers anyway.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let's get back to Geoffrey's timeline, soda speak.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey got in many fights at school, seemingly at the drop of a hat. Once, he broke a kid's nose. He had it coming, of course. My father is no bully. Anyways the fighting got to be a bit of a problem, but come high school Geoffrey straightened out and flew right. Only thing is, he stopped going. He stayed up all night, slept in, and was late pretty much every day. The towering diplomat, Grandfather Tom, stepped in, and brokered a deal with the school which gave Geoffrey a chance to go to school at night and get his diploma. Geoffrey did well at night school and bade the academic system a fond farewell.<br />
<br />
Misfortune seemed to strike the Villanova Wilsons with one thing after another, resulting in what has been referred to as the "Fall of Saigon". One day, while driving home from a Temple football game (Grandfather's alma mater), the Wilson boys got into a minor accident. However minor the accident was, Grandfather sustained a knee injury when it smashed into the dashboard. This was score one, mortality's first notification, the first strike against Grandfather Tom.<br />
The knee injury took away Grandfather's ability to walk properly. While in the hospital, a doctor (who shall remain nameless, if only because I do not know his name) decided that he was suffering from an overactive pituitary gland, citing his large, nay, gigantic hands. Much to Grandfather's chagrin, the medical powers that be zapped his brain with gamma rays to destroy the pesky gland. Grandfather often complained of never being able to think straight after that. In an apparent attempt at further humiliation (or apologetic levity), the radiation procedures left a perfectly square bald spot on the top of his head, among the "shock of white hair" he maintained in his later years.<br />
At the height of Grandfather's various illnesses, a choice few of his business partners abandoned investments and left him penniless, despite Grandfather's Marcel Viti-esque professionalism and the financial help he seemed to grant everyone around him. He could no longer work as an attorney to pay the bills. The Wilsons had to leave their Villanova home, and during this tumultuous process, a choice few family members took more than their fair share of Grandfather's belongings, in the stated/requested interest of lightening the load. Doubtless among these plundered treasures were some of Marcel Viti's artifacts and antiques, left to Tom at the occasion of his death. These glorious, dusty vessels and paintings still haunt, or grace, the halls, storage rooms, and attics of the Wilsons, like stolen and incredulous yet silent monuments from an Egyptian tomb.<br />
<br />
Following Tom's lead, Brian and Geoffrey drove west to California, the hot and arid coastal land of Hollywood, gang violence, and free homosexuality. Jane, the youngest child, was left to head the Wilson ship. She was fine with that and never resented the Wilson boys at all. It was a somewhat naive but necessary venture for the Wilson boys (now big &amp; tall men) to follow, yet one which opened my dad up to the world of neon shorts.<br />
My dad lived in California in the mid-1980s. I can only guess at what kind of world this was, but my vision includes lots of cocaine, Hispanic people, and racial hatred. It was a fun, easygoing time in America though, and I'm sure overall it was a pleasant environment to be around. Ahem. So, the three Wilson boys gallivanted a bunch and worked at many, many bars and restaurants as bouncers, bartenders, and food prep guys. My dad met countless celebrities, and even bunked with a few. These included Howie Mendel, Andrew Dice Clay, and Blake Clark, renowned player of every unintelligible Southern man in a comedy ever. I don't know. It was the '80s.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G2qN-kdJ5Pc/V9XbnblXgjI/AAAAAAAAARg/U2-7a__8Xjc8U7Nya0GWx5chgbI-c776QCLcB/s1600/New%2BMexico.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G2qN-kdJ5Pc/V9XbnblXgjI/AAAAAAAAARg/U2-7a__8Xjc8U7Nya0GWx5chgbI-c776QCLcB/s320/New%2BMexico.jpg" width="218" /></a></div>
Following Tom's success on the big screen and budding romance with his soon-to-be wife, the Wilson boys began to settle down. That is, Tom and Brian settled down. Geoffrey went back home for a bit, and, apparently deciding Pennsylvania was once again too much to bear, hopped in his little powder blue Datsun (1981 B210, to be precise) and traveled the U.S. of A. Yessum, he visited every state in this here sovereign land except for three, those being the barren and cold North Dakota and the non-contiguous crap-lands of Alaska and Hawaii. He saw many things on this journey, and was better for it. After a while, Geoffrey felt weather-beaten but wise and fulfilled. The only thing he needed now was a woman.<br />
Geoffrey returned yet again to a place called home, and sort of hung around like the curly-haired dope he was. He eventually met my mom through the spunky, youthful game of volleyball, facilitated by the local church and single moms' club, where my mom and Anna May Wilson became friends. I won't do too much stuff about my parents meeting each other, it gets a little soapy. The Matzik children were shocked to see a new and often annoying man in their life, but eventually grew used to him. Geoffrey would be forever named "Mr. Zip" by the Matzik children, upon reading his Pizza Hut name tag, which read, "ZIPPY". I guess this was because my dad was full of energy and always zipping around and stuff. Either way, it's better than "Step-Dad". Step-Dad, can I borrow the car? Step-Dad, will you buy me that RC car?<br />
<br />
Mom &amp; Dad married in 1994, and bought a lil' blue house in Phoenixville, PA, with the help of some very wealthy distant relatives &amp; family friends, particularly the late Great-Uncle Abe and Olga Kralovec, a client of Grandpa Wilson with a cool Slavic name. These being two folks who kicked the bucket and left a large sum to any and all living descendants or friends. I don't mean to deal with this subject so lightly; these two wealthy benefactors basically ensured that I had a place to live for my first 18 years of life. Such a thing like that should not ever escape your mind, nor has it mine. There's a spirit of commemoration to this <i>Bildungsroman,</i> in that I wish to get these names, biographies, and events down on paper (ha) while I still can and keep these people alive.<br />
<br />
Ah, Phoenixville. A thriving steel town filled with promise (and ethnic factory workers), once heralded as a war machine for the Union, was by the 1980s a hub of prostitution, alcoholism, and drug use. Why raise me here, you ask? Tales are told that family pioneers Aunt Sue and Uncle Joe moved there and blazed the trail for the Geist family. After Sue and Joe came the grandparents. Then, a few Aunts &amp; Uncles moved there. Soon, it became a regular hub of Wilson and Geist kinfolk. You see, it was a time of renewal, the 1990s. The Baby Boomers were having kids of their own. The untold violence of the early '90s was over, and people could finally settle down and have little babies without having them being stolen and sold for their organs. It was a delightful time to be born. Although, it would seem that toys went downhill after the '80s. Maybe it was a Japanese-American trade agreement or something.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this leads me to my birth and my subsequent revenge on those who had betrayed me in my Shirley MacLaine past lives as an elephant, cicada, and baby alligator. The circumstances of my creation are still being investigated by anthropologists around the globe, but I'll tell you what I know to be true.<br />

My name is Luke Edward Wilson. I was born at either 1:18pm or 1:08pm (records differ; it was too cold to think straight) on the 9th of January in the year 1996, at Phoenixville Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, USA. It was during a historic blizzard where many of my kinfolk were outside, shoveling 4-foot-high piles of snow out of their driveways. My father was (and remains) Geoffrey Lawrence Wilson, and my mother was (and remains) Amy Beth Geist. They decided to get married before I was born, however, so my mom's married name when I came out was Amy Beth Wilson. From a previous marriage, my mom had (and still has) two kids. The elder daughter was named Beth Ann Matzik, and the younger son was named Michael Scott Matzik II, after his biological father. These people comprise my nuclear (so-called in apparent reference to the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) family.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In this user-friendly blog, I hope to write a somewhat comprehensive memoir of my life. As of now, I am 20-years-old. Yessir, I've been alive here on the rocky Earth longer than humanity's greatest invention and a milestone in manufactured plastics: the iPod. In the September of my years, I peer fondly beyond the faded yet vivid curtain of time, into the grainy film of yesteryear, the dusty golden stacks of photos and expired documents, to reconcile a profound truth and hand it out facsimiled like a free, knock-off Livestrong (TM) bracelet. Yes, before I grow old, before I kick the ever-loving bucket, I shall detail at length the follies, misadventures, and heroic adventures contained within the dog-eared years/months of my life. Alright, enough of this queer, yellow dancing about the rotten truth of the matter: I am a bored college student in search of an artistic path of least resistance. At first glance, it appears to be pretty simple to write a memoir, especially when you've only had a working memory for, like, 15 years. Yessir, I'll be recalling fantastical yet everyday tales from within a span of fifteen bloody years. Are you not excited? You shouldn't be. Starbuck's Cold-Brewed Iced Coffee seems to be the only potion which gives me the energy and creative juices (they are referring to drugs) required to write even a medium-length paragraph. In other words: I'll never finish this mem-wa.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
To start, I'll talk (hopefully not too long) about the gene pool I emerged from, or, the two families I was born into and descend from. What I said in the parentheses refers to the fact that my most recent hobby has been genealogy and I can't seem to kick it. I could reminisce about people who I'm not even sure existed and whom I've certainly never met enough to fill a Harry Potter-sized book. This would be foolish. This book, uhm, this blog is about ME, and that's how it will be. However, I love family histories and character studies, and I think others might too, so I will talk about a few of my family members in detail as well.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I descend, yes, I descend from the Geist and Wilson families. Let's start with the soggy Geists.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<u>GEIST FAMILY TALES</u></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
My grandfather's name was Robert "Bob" Gill Geist, and he was born in rural Baltimore in 1922. He was the only child of a sales manager at Colgate-Palmolive &amp; Peet Co.--where they sold soap--and a nurse, who died fairly young of a brain tumor. Today, you can find Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive dish soap at any grocery store, but I'm not sure which bumbelark, hokey-pokey jungle you'd have to wander into to find&nbsp;<i>Peet</i>. Robert's family was enormous and consisted of country folk. As a matter of fact, his parents were cousins! A-hem.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Robert Geist was a perfectionist. He folded his towels neatly as a maid at an expensive resort, packed his tobacco pipe like a surgeon, and watched TV like a wall (a more quiet wall). He was always thinking, planning, or ruminating. He even thought out loud, and read the mail and newspaper out loud. It makes sense that he was a systems analyst. No system big or small seemed to go un-analyzed by Bob. He worked for Esso (now Exxon) for over 30 years. For this grand achievement, you receive a medium-sized grandfather clock.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
But, before Bob ever dreamt of analyzing systems at Esso, Uncle Sam sent him to war.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Bob was shipped over seas during WWII and served at a marine base on Guam. The island was hot, and the war was on. Bob completed his training through the bugs and tropical sun. He would never see combat, however, after a car accident sent him straight back home. One day, while riding on the back of a truck with two other soldiers, a truck coming down the dirt road the opposite direction lost control and clipped theirs. In what was a fairly violent crash, one of the men on the back of the truck got the bones in his pelvis "mashed up" and another soldier, closest to Bob, was killed. Bob lived to tell the tale (or not), despite receiving significant injuries to his arm and leg. His uniform, complete with its patches and medals, remains intact to this day.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
When Bob came home, he (presumably) sat around for a while. But when the war ended, the party was on. It was during and because of these probably wild and crazy post-war parties that Bob met my grandmother.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
My grandmother's name was Helen Ann Hill, or as she was called pretty much her entire life, "Bebe". This referred to her status as the baby of the family. She was born in 1925 in Westfield, NJ to a terminally quiet and anxious mathematician and a mother described as "cold steel". She had 4 siblings: Norma, Charles, Elizabeth, and Tuey (Stanley).&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Norma was confident, successful, and lively in the social setting. I met and visited her a few times before she passed away in 2006. She was 93 years old and had lived a very (very) long and full life. She referred to things as "beautiful" and fell asleep when anyone brushed her hair.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Charles was an organist and served during WWII on a base in Texas. He didn't like it very much. We have many pictures of him, as he was close with Bebe. He lived with his partner, Jack, until his death in 1999. Jack is 98 and still alive in Delaware. I've debated with myself about whether or not it would be weird to go and meet him.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Elizabeth was quite close to Bebe as the younger yet still older sister in the family. Sadly, she died from complications with asthma at age 25. (I realize this has become a list of obituaries, bear with me).&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Tuey was an interesting character. He apparently inherited a great deal of worry and anxiety from his father, and it did not seem to help that he was caught by surprise by the Germans in the historic Battle of the Bulge during WWII. As his son Jeffrey would recount, Tuey had incessant road rage, xenophobia, and feverish nightmares, often precipitated by planes flying over the house. He died of a heart attack at age 44.&nbsp;</div>

Bebe (later, "Gamma") was a shy young woman. She came from a shy family, but was overshadowed by her older and slightly-less-shy siblings. But being the Bebe/Baby garnered her some attention. When she got to college, she resolved to become apart of the social world and be someone completely different than the shy Bebe of childhood age. With her Bebe shell shed, she left college at the end of WWII and got a-groovin' and a-shakin'. She met Bob, and they decided to create a new generation called "the Baby Boomers". These being five kids: Larry, Mary Lou, Sue, Amy, and Steven.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
John Lawrence (Uncle Larry) was the oldest child, hence why I listed him first (just so you understand). He was tall, and from video evidence it can be determined that he was a silly and creative young boy. His early childhood was essentially <i>Leave It To Beaver.</i>&nbsp;What I mean is, he was the quintessential 1950's boy, and subsequently the quintessential 1960s teenager (he had the long hair, at least). He married his college girlfriend Kathleen, who is a teacher. They travel the corners of the globe together. Today, Larry is the fireworks technician at Fourth of July parties and a master of one-liners and fruit salad. Also notable are his holiday gifts, wrapped in cartoons cut from newspapers.</div>
<div>
Mary Lou (Aunt Mearnie) was the second child. I know I did that joke already, but really, that's the only thing I know regarding her childhood, except maybe that she can be found in photo albums wearing very 1960's outfits as a teenager. She married Mark, my Tennessee-born Uncle, who is famous in our town for his beautiful garden, and famous in our family for having the loudest laugh. Today, Mearnie is the de facto matriarch + Supreme Leader of the Geist family, and we are better for it. She is also pretty funny and always kind. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
Suzanne (Aunt Sue) was the second daughter of the Geist family. Sue and Mary Lou were 1960's sisters who listened to folk rock and did other things. Sue was a kind soul who started a pre-K school called Footsteps Academy with some friends, which I attended. I always remember begging to play on her computer there, which had some sort of penguin game that I was obsessed with. She married Joe, a nature enthusiast and maker of maps. Joe was a talented musician and generous Uncle, and taught me a lot of what I know about playing guitar.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
(skipping my mom for a moment)</div>
<div>
Steven (Uncle Steve) was the fifth and final child of the Geist family. He was a rambunctious and energetic child who frolicked about with the family's ferocious dog, "Pup". His teen years were rocky and fraught with misfortune. He acquired insecurity and devastating shyness and withdrew from teenage life. A particular low-point was when he was injured in an accidental explosion involving a homemade pipe bomb. The other kid involved had his fingers blown off, some of which landed on someone's roof. He was chair-ridden for a while, but Bebe made sure his friends came by through creating a fun and safe atmosphere. He married Donna, and had one daughter, Caitlyn. I hung out with these folks a whole lot as a young child. Aunt Donna always let us have fun, including when we went to Dutch Wonderland every year. Caitlyn was my partner-in-crime, as we were the closest in age out of our cousins. In Bebe's basement, we would take turns sitting on a rolling Ottoman, holding on to a long rubber tube, and being hurled around on the cement floor as the other ran around in circles. This was fun until someone yelled at us.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<u>MAMA</u></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Amy (Mom) was the fourth child of the Geist family. Extremely shy, she could not speak in front of the class at school, and did not really branch out socially until high school. Some of her formative experiences include seeing a classmate vomit purple and white onto a teacher's desk, having her favorite neighborhood dog get run over and killed, getting bit in the face by Pup the Dog, getting bit by yet another dog (this time a German Shepherd and coincidentally her least favorite neighborhood dog), and being told sternly by Debbie Reynolds to "speak up". It wasn't all bad though: she learned to straighten her hair in high school, and as a result fostered friendships with her classmates. Around this time, she met her first husband, Mike.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Michael Scott Matzik the First was a man from a Slovak and English family of much eccentricity. He was tall, sported a mustache and a ponytail, and liked Led Zeppelin. My mom, who had come from a shy, mostly normal, and patently non-ethnic household, had to assimilate into what was basically another culture, one that involved strange foods, language, and even rituals. Mike's mother, "Mom-Mom" was a prolific cook with a loud voice, commanding personality, and colorful vocabulary. (It has always tickled me, the idea of the fabled Mom-Mom sitting and talking with Bebe, our mild-mannered Gamma, who longed for a movie or TV show where no one ever got sad, said a curse word, or was mean to someone else). Amy and Mike married in 1980, when my mom was 19 and fresh out of high school. Their first child, Dawn Nicole Matzik, was born with heart problems, and died at one month of age at CHOP in Philadelphia. Today, Dawn would be 35 years old, a concept which is constantly mind-boggling to me. These trying and tragic moments were a catalyst in my mom's faith as a Christian, and would not stop the couple from having two more happy, dopey kids.</div>
<div>
In 1985, they had Beth Ann. She looked Asian when she was born, and almost entirely Matzik as she grew older. She had a strong personality and was, as I'm told, spoiled as a young girl. We'll talk more about Beth when we get to my stinkin' life.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
In 1988, they had Michael Scott II, the pride and joy of the First and elder Michael. He was a dopey boy with a blonde bowl-cut, whose job, it seemed, was to be pummeled or otherwise messed with by Beth on a daily basis. His demeanor as a child is the subject of much laughter in our family. He always seemed to be pleading desperately with someone to believe and understand his point of view, one which no one could ever get close to believing or understanding. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
Unfortunately, problems arose in the lives and marriage of Amy and Mike. Once the joy of Michael II being born faded, Mike I grew increasingly impatient with Amy and was not very agreeable in domestic life. Amy left several times, but was ultimately successfully pleaded with to return. However, one fateful argument over the correct way to make tomato sauce drove Amy over the edge, and she decided it was time to leave. She left Mike I sometime around 1990, filed for divorce, and was granted custody of Beth and Mike. The three moved into Amy's parents house, and there they would stay until Mr. Zip of Old came 'round.&nbsp;</div>

<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The following is a review of&nbsp;a certain&nbsp;2012 film entitled, "The Perks of Being&nbsp;A Wallflower". You have been warned. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></em><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">So, when I first saw the trailer for this thing, I almost gagged myself. But that's just my personality, really. I hate young adult parables that are rife with cliches and things that remind me of middle school (not freshman year of high school). But, I really felt like watching it yesterday for some reason. I figured it would be fun, considering how painful it would be and considering how much hate I would feel for it (lol). So me and my brother watched it.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Logan Lerman deserves to be hanged for his performance. It was overdone and underdone. He kept making that stupid smirk to appear "socially awkward", a disgustingly banal term in of itself that the synopsis of the film uses. Emma Watson was hot and awesome but her character was stupid. I actually didn't want to strangle Ezra Miller, he actually did pretty well, though him being gay was ridiculous, and the subplot of him and the jock was also ridiculous. It was hard to relate to (I promise). The cafeteria fight was unrealistic and badly directed. The drug use was approached in a casual manner, and I didn't like that. It wasn't as dark or realistic;&nbsp;it was treated like eating cookies and candy. "Oh lemme just grab that blotter of LSD heueheueheuhe". </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Logan Lerman is an actor child, he doesn't get nearly close enough to the lifestyle of any character in the movie. His friend shot himself? His aunt died? He has depression? What a great way to humble young viewers and/or make him seem realistic and/or help us relate to him! He's complaining about being lonely as a freshman, but has a fantastic relationship with an intelligent teacher, has a comedian and Emma Watson as friends, has a gift for writing and music, and, well, has a family of some sort. It's so hard being unique!!!!&nbsp;Waaaah, I have successful older siblings, waaaahhh.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">I apologize for how badly organized this review is, but all of this hate comes at once. I can't help it. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">This idea has been exploited before in so many ways; this film was useless. The Rocky Horror part of the film was just an added quirk to shove the idea of having a quirky group of friends into our unwilling faces. "WE ARE SO COOL BECAUSE WE CROSS DRESS HEHEHEHEH". The fact that he felt "infinite" riding in a truck listening to mediocre music was nauseating. My anger for that line is irrepressible. Well, he is hanging out with Emma Watson. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Nothing in this film is properly explained. Scenes end without going anywhere or having punchlines, subplots and different paths go unexplored, and the attempts at segmented storytelling&nbsp;are colossal failures. The only interesting idea was when you realize he had trouble with girls touching him because of his perverted, insane aunt (which isn't properly laid out for us either). Did he go gay with Patrick?&nbsp; He sees things? What?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The climax was unfulfilled, depressing, and not exploited to its full potential. A steak knife? Blacking out? Joan Cusack (best character in the film)? </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The good things about the film were the few jokes it had and Emma Watson's face. Yeah. Also, the filter it was put in was nice to look at. Also, they definitely put some sort of effort into making it look like the '90s. The idea of him being an avid reader/writer should have been exploited MUCH much more. But "On the Road"? THAT PISSES ME OFF. I will NOT have my Jack Kerouac used by some retarded writer to make this whiny teenager seem&nbsp;cultured and interesting!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">I give this film an 18%. Paul Rudd, though? Heh. Kids, there's nothing wrong with your life if you are talented and have fun, senior friends, but there is something wrong with YOU if a traffic tunnel makes you feel "infinite" and you&nbsp;take LSD to forget your feelings. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">This hipster, young adult path of mixtapes and misused words has gone far enough. Juno, with the worst leads ever (Michael Cera and Ellen Page) used up that privilege and wasted&nbsp;your chances to be quirky. Napoleon Dynamite holds the trophy in my heart. Don't take yourselves so goshdarn seriously, kids. "OH MY GOD LET'S MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT QUIRKY KI--" *gets shot*. The attempts to&nbsp;be&nbsp;edgy in this film were just dumb. DUMB.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">This film made me feel like crap. Let's just stop whining, people. Stop the freaking whining. Oh, I am the whiner? Hmph. Okay, let's agree to both stop whining, Mr. Hollywood and your horrible, skewed&nbsp;perception of youth. Is nothing sacred or pure?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">I still think Emma Watson is awesome, but she will always be Hermione Granger to me. </span><br />

<em>"All those years, they were here first."</em><br />
<em></em><br />
I went to Bethlehem today, the retro steel town nestled in a heaven-like basin of high mountains. It was for a German class field trip, and I was accompanied by the good ol' boys, Connor Herring and Ian Straka. Connor doesn't speak, and Ian speaks too much. He had way too much coffee, and so did I. I bought myself my favorite candle today from my favorite Bethlehem candle guy (at the Christkindlmarkt we go to annually). It is titled, ALPINE FROST, and it is heavenly. I escaped my brothers egg-cooking smell in my room and lit that jawn. I wrote a song, sortof. I had pierogies and they were damn good. <br />
<br />
The End. daerhahsds

<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"I think she's the prettiest lady I've ever seen. Her hair, it has meaning and volume and such a sheen."</span></em><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">1.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">I arrived&nbsp;at crisp sunrise&nbsp;on the back of my dark horse to the doors of Summer's Castle. Getting down from my horse, I was keen to avoid dirtying my&nbsp;fresh leather boots, for which the market had seen a pretty penny from me. I avoided eye contact with the&nbsp;mercenaries on either side of me, tarantula hands on their holsters. I made haste up the stone steps to the computer. I removed my leather glove and swiftly typed in my title and number. Upon opening the door, the cacophony of the crowd inside overtook me. Beggars, peasants, and mercenaries screaming and crying about insurance, wages, and legal matters. Some were drinking heavily from their bottles and&nbsp;some shameless ones were even fornicating. In fact, a great many were engaging in some sort of sexual act. The guards did nothing. I rudely pushed and shoved my way through the rather smelly group, assuming my needs and wants were&nbsp;of a higher standard. I came into the golden sunlight shining through the beautiful windows. The King Jasper and Queen Chloe were sitting, nay, laying in their gilded thrones, barely awake, mumbling denial and murmuring rejection. Their tired eyes suddenly fixed themselves on me, the son of a gun who deemed himself more important than the other village people and walked himself up to the feet of the King and Queen themselves. The&nbsp;slumped,&nbsp;unshaven&nbsp;King awoke out of his sleepy reverie and blustered his way into words.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Markus! Grab this damned fool and throw him back to the groundlings!"</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">I was shocked, not knowing the rules of the royal hall, never having been there before.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Forgive me, your Highness! Forgive me! I-", I stammered, but it was too late to save myself. Markus, the&nbsp;stoic figure seated in the dark, sighed and got to his feet. He firmly grasped my shoulders and literally threw me backwards with surprising strength, sending me&nbsp;into the air. I fell hard onto a wooden bench which tipped over and sent me rolling onto a group of lowly laborers, sitting in awe of the catastrophic exchange. I clamored back over the bench with eager energy and attempted to explain myself, silently forgiving Markus in light of the matters at hand.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Forgive me, Royal Jasper! My manners were beside me! I come to you in much emergency! I ask kindly for your listening ears."</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">He made no response, his head propped up lazily by his fist. I took this as approval and I drew&nbsp;a long breath.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Your Highness, I come unto you in great distress. I-"</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE BLEEDIN'&nbsp;VILLAGE YOU SELFISH PRAT!", shrieked an elderly woman from the crowd. I ignored her and the cheers she received.</span></em><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><em>"Beautiful Queen Chloe, I understand you have&nbsp;a soft spot for young men looking for love.", I boldly proposed. </em><em>Her silken song of a voice...</em></span><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Even in your young testosterone years, you have lost your mind's keen edge. I have no heart for hormones."</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Oh...But, I have a fair woman in mind."</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Jasper let out a deep laugh. "Boy, you've come to the King for a wench? You and your lack of brains can enter yon whore house and buy yourself a girl!"</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Jasper, have some respect for our noble boy here!", his wife snapped.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">My sullen face grew a shining grin of hope.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Come with me, boy." </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">But she didn't move. She led her glowing hand through the air and directed me to a chest beside her. I scaled the steps and reached for the box, but she snatched my arm with a firm but soft hand.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Wait..." She feels my heart beat, and her eyes open. She produces a golden key from around her neck and unlocks the chest. It is filled with small bits of parchment. She motions me to take one. I took the smallest one I could find. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">"Do not look upon it until you have left the castle. Good luck."</span></em><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><em>Her husband looked on, seemingly perturbed. </em><em>My mouth agape, I folded my bit of parchment, slipped it into my pocket, and went on my way.</em></span><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The sun glowed golden on my hands and I stood on the dirt road, feeling&nbsp;so much the cold morning.&nbsp;I mounted my horse. In the sunlight, I took the parchment and looked upon it. Digitally printed in ink were the numbers, 070496, and this poem:</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></em><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Oakwood, cedarwood, ashwood,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">He did and had done all he could,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">But broken apart are they.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">White and green and all over red,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">She falls lightly on the bed,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">But broken inside is she. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Never fear her gator tears,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Beautiful dove, graceful deer,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">But a thorny rose is she. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times;">Bedroom eyes&nbsp;lay into thee,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times;">Done and done, you'll never see,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times;">But a thorny&nbsp;boy are you.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times;"></span><br />
